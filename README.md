# tennisPredictor

This is a simple tennis predicting program, based solely on the point-probabilities of each player. This program has two options, withDeuce and withoutDeuce, showing that the Deuce scoring system in tennis favours the better player, while the withoutDeuce scoring system favours the worse player. Furthermore, the program shows the importance of consistency in tennis, because at a constant 0.6 point probability, there is a greater than 96% chance that the player wins the whole game.
